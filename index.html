                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hello! I'm Dylan Gee, welcome to my personal portfolio page. I'm a university graduate with a degree in Biotechnology, with a new yet keen interest in coding. Working with code first fasinated me during my 
                    dissertion when I used R and RStudio to map relationships between genes. I also got to use to large databases in my projects which sparked an interest in databases and data handling. Although these were tricky
                    at the time they really captivated me, so much so that I opted to created additional heatmaps just to use RStudios more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I currently work for a magazine distrubtion company analyising data to determime how much supply retailers should recieve based on previous sales history. I'm enjoying my time there but my goal is to work in a role which enables me to 
                    work with large sets of raw data and build programs/software/databases that encorporate the data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To pursue my goals, I'm currently undertaking a course which teaches me HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, PHP and a number of other languages. I believe that being trained in all these langauges will provide me the skills to work in any programming
                    role although Python is my favourite language at the moment and I look forward to using it more and developing my skills as a programmer as a whole.
                </p>
